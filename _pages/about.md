Hi there! I'm a master student at University of Waterloo, studying software engineering. My interests lie within software development, automation and machine learning.

I received my B.S degree in software engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2020 and studied at McMaster University as an exchange student from 2018 to 2019.

Here is my [resume]().
